  gen_tcpd behaviour
======================

gen_tcpd is an erlang behaviour for TCP accept loops.  gen_tcpd lets you
implement a tcp server with lots of flexibility, but takes care of
dealing with accepting new connections and delivers them using a
callback. Since gen_tcpd is an OTP behaviour your module will be put
under a supervisor and will integrate naturally in any OTP application.
